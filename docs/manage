DISCOUNTS:
Validation:
    validate_discount() - checks for input errors
    is_discount_active() - returns true if discount is active (by 'active' field) and is inside its date boundaries
    error reporting in submitted forms - 
        view sends a tuple ('field_name', 'error message') (created by validate_discount()) to template;
        template checks for that and if there are any, shows them
